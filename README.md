# Permissions
Android, Java, Permissions

The purpose of this project is to handle some cases of permissions that are needed among developing apps.

I've implemented three different ways how to make a request for permission:

1- For first implementation I used the checkSelfPermission and requestPermissions methods.

2- For second implementation I used EasyPermissions library.

3- For third implementation I used PermissionsDispatcher library.
